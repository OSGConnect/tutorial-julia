# Running Julia on the OSPool

This tutorial has template files for running Julia jobs. 

Follow the instructions on the [OSG Connect guides page](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/software_examples/other_languages_tools/julia-on-osg/) to run a complete 
job, using the version of Julia you choose, and using `test.jl` as the example script.
